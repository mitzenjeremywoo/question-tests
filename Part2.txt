Scalable and highly available architecture 

1. AWS cloudfront to front incoming traffic to the applications. 
Offering high performance, low latency, regional aware request routing feature. 
Optional feature: Adding cloudfront or Akamai to help with DDOS / bots attacks. 
This help to improve security against unwanted requested.

2. Setup a active/active cluster across 2 AWS region 
namely Sydney and Melbourne. If any of the region is down, we can failover to another region.
Other region besides Sydney and melbourne can be consider too.
EC2 instance uses 
AWS Autoscaling is used to scale instances based on current workload.

3. Each AWS autoscaling are fronted by Application Load Balancer to 
evenly distribute request to EC2 instances. It support TLS termination to simplify TLS integration in application.
It also supports sticky session if required.

4. Next application will be deployed and use shared service such as 
SQL Server, SQS or KMS. These service are configure to be zone redundant 
that allows continuation of service in case one service goes down in Melbourne for example. 

5. Most importantly, application needs to be architected to be faulty tolerant 
and resillent by implementing different types of cloud pattern such as circuit breaker, cache aside 
and able to support transicnt failures or duplicate records in SQS.
