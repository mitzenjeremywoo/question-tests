When it comes to AWS Intermittent failure issues there can be many possbile reasons. 
First we need to figure out which component is failing. Let's say we have an application that is deployed to AWS lambda that is experiencing this issue. 

Diagnosis steps
1. Go to lambda's monitor and check the metrics. We are trying to find out a pattern for this intermittent issues and potentially support our root cause analysis. 
- in cloudwatch metric check for "invocation" and "error count and success rate" and trottling. 
  Having some understanding of how the app works would be good. Is the trottling causes timeout hence dropping the requests.

- check memory consumption patterns - is the memory usage too high that causes application to be able to process certain while dropping the rest of the request - hence contributing to intermittent issue.

- check cpu consumption patterns  is the cpu usage too high that causes application to be able to process certain while dropping the rest of the request - hence contributing to intermittent issue.

- Scale the metrics from 1 - 2 weeks, to see if this has been happening in the past 1 week. If not, then something must have changed recently. We need to figure out what changed on application side or infrastructure side.
