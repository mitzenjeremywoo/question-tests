Question 4.

SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.sslast_name, d.department_name from employee e LEFT JOIN 
department d on e.department_id = d.department_id WHERE e.hire_date > '2020-01-01' ORDER BY e.last_name

Answer

Issues

This query will returns all record from employee table on top of those that matches the e.hire_date > '2020-01-01' criteria. 
This lead to unnecessary retrieval of data. 


Optimization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INNER JOIN 
-----------

Consider using INNER JOIN to retrieve ponly matched records

SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.sslast_name, d.department_name from employee e INNER JOIN 
department d on e.department_id = d.department_id WHERE e.hire_date > '2020-01-01' ORDER BY e.last_name

With this query, only records that employees that matches the department_id would be retrieved. 


Creting Non-clustered index
----------------------------

Create Non cluster Index based on Employee_Id, department_id and hire_date

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX Idx_Employee_EmployeeDeptHireDate on Employee (Employee_Id, department_id, hire_date)

This index is optimized for the query above and hence should be faster with the cost of additional storage. 

Side notes
-------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Always review SQL execution plan to see the results of performance optimization.
